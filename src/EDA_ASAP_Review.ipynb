Given labeled samples from a source domain and unlabeled samples from a target domain , this paper proposes to minimize the risk on the target domain by jointly learning the shift-invariant representation and the re-weighting function for the induced representations . According to Lemma 1 and its finite sample version in Theorem 1 , the risk on the target domain can be upper bounded by the combination of 1 ) the re-weighted empirical risk on the source domain ; and 2 ) the distributional discrepancy between the re-weighted source domain and the target domain . These theoretical results justify the objective function shown in Equation 8 . Experiments on the IHDP dataset demonstrates the advantage of the proposed approach compared to its competing alternatives . Comments : 1 ) This paper is well motivated . For the task of prediction under the shift in design , shift-invariant representation learning ( Shalit 2017 ) is biased even in the inifite data limit . On the other hand , although re-weighting methods are unbiased , they suffer from the drawbacks of high variance and unknown optimal weights . The proposed approach aims to overcome these drawbacks . 2 ) The theoretical results justify the optimization procedures presented in section 5 . Experimental results on the IHDP dataset confirm the advantage of the proposed approach . 3 ) I have some questions on the details . In order to make sure the second equality in Equation 2 holds , p_mu ( y|x , t ) = p_pi ( y|x , t ) should hold as well . Is this a standard assumption in the literature ? 4 ) Two drawbacks of previous methods motivate this work , including the bias of representation learning and the high variance of re-weighting . According to Lemma 1 , the proposed method is unbiased for the optimal weights in the large data limit . However , is there any theoretical guarantee or empirical evidence to show the proposed method does not suffer from the drawback of high variance ? 5 ) Experiments on synthetic datasets , where both the shift in policy and the shift in domain are simulated and therefore can be controlled , would better demonstrate how the performance of the proposed approach ( and thsoe baseline methods ) changes as the degree of design shift varies . 6 ) Besides IHDP , did the authors run experiments on other real-world datasets , such as Jobs , Twins , etc ?\",\n          \"The authors present sharp criteria for l_1-sparse support recovery under small noise in the context of non-smooth regression losses l_\\\\infty and l_1 . Traditionally , the problem studied in support recovery left the loss shape fixed at MSE ( l2^2 ) loss and explored different non-smooth penalties , starting from the work of Fuchs on l1 penalty up until the recent , possibly most general partly smooth penalties of Vaiter et al .In the present contribution , the authors keep the simple l1 penalty but explore the effect of changing the loss function . Concretely , two loss functions , l_\\\\infty and l_1 are studied . Both share the characteristic of being polyhedral . A proof for both cases is given , along with some confirmatory experimental results . This paper presents a new angle of generalization of the l_1 support recovery criteria to other types of loss functions , which are generally useful in regression : l_\\\\infty corresponds to a uniform noise assumption , whereas l_1 corresponds to a sparse noise assumption . In performing this generalization , it exhibits the functionality of some quantities also obtained in the classic MSE + l1 setting , but which at the time were too specific to be given names . We thus have a non-trivial step forward in the understanding of the mechanisms involved . The proofs in the main paper are sound . However , my main comments concern the readability of this contribution . This paper took me by far the longest to review , because while mathematically perfectly rigorous , it is as if the authors a ) underestimate the fact that their contribution is some non-trivial convex analysis , that they b ) do not seem to be interested in making any concessions to the reader by providing their own intuitions or figures elucidating them and c ) that this may lead to reviews that completely miss the point of the paper . Specifically , my points are * It would be great to have a small diagram explaining the regression problem in 1D or 2D , especially since l_1 and l_\\\\infty losses are equal , resp .equivalent in these two settings . There is sufficient space to add this without deleting anything . * up until a certain point in the paper , the paper works with general dual pairs \\\\alpha , \\\\beta whose harmonic mean is 1 . At some point this specializes to the polyhedral losses and later in the paper specializes to the l_\\\\infy loss ( l1 in supp mat ) . These transitions have to be made more clear . It would be helpful also to state what intuitions are needed to keep the general ( \\\\alpha , \\\\beta ) ( i.e .\\\\alpha \\\\in ( 1 , \\\\infty ) is not polyhedral so the proof is different , but here is how you would go about it , but here is why we do n't do this in this paper ) . * In general , the first reading of this paper is difficult , because many notations are introduced a posteriori . One arrives at table 1 and spends some time looking for definitions of \\\\tilde\\\\Phi and S . These are introduced in the lines below . Then one assumes |S| = |J| , which seems surprising , and is referred forward to Lemma 2 for discussion , instead of giving a quick intuition that this is not only `` for simplicity `` but even `` almost surely holds `` in a probabilistic setting and is a reasonable assumption , before referring to the details mentioned in lemma 2 . There are also several formulae which introduce a symbol and state in the next lines `` , where [ symbol ] means [ meaning ] `` . Could these be put before the formula ? * l120 concerning the situation where I ! = J , there is also [ Tibshirani , The Lasso problem and uniqueness ] . While the paper seems to state something that is implicit in many previous contributions , it would be worth being a little more explicit in how these relate * It took me 3 readings to see the bold r in regularization in l139 to make the link to FO_r . Please introduce explicitly FO_r and FO_\\\\beta . Additionally , it would be helpful to make it a bit clearer , by adding an intermediate step , what `` corresponds `` means in l139 . Not all readers are versed enough in convex duality to read this easily . In general , since there still remains half a page of space , a way of obtaining the Fenchel dual ( e.g .by introducing the lagrangian , splitting primal variables and minimizing it wrt both of them ) and first order conditions could also be given . * It would be great to have a bit more intuition on the Lagrange multipliers v_\\\\beta ( and some more intuition on p_\\\\beta can be helpful too ) . In which space do they live ( the same as x resp .same as y ) . How can one imagine them geometrically ? The polytope defined by the regression constraint is difficult to untangle in the space of x , since one does n't know which constraints are active . This polytope is an intersection of seminorm balls , which could even be illustrated in 2D . Diagrams , although not easy to make , would help readers enormously . * between line 189 and 190 , does it have to be p_ { 1 , S } ? Minor * l192 `` So now , `` - > `` Now `` * l194 hypotheses - > hypothesis * between l200 and l201 put a word between the formulas `` or the second line which implies the first by operator inequality `` * l202 get - > obtain * l207 get - > obtain * l248 exceeds - > exceed * l255 theoertical -\",\n          \"The paper proposes a graph neural network based method to solve the retrosynthesis prediction problem , that is the identification of the reactions which lead to a particular target . In particular , the proposed graphical model exploit ideas from graph neural networks , in order to learn informative representation . Furthermore , expert knowledge from chemistry rules can be integrated in order to consider known restrictions and to provide interpretable solutions . The paper well describes the background and task of interest . However , I find the notation and model derivations to be hard to follow . The results show very promising performances , but could be more comprehensive and I find the methodological contribution to be limited . Detailed comments are provided below . 1 ) Overall , I found the model design choices to be not properly justified . I would suggest to clarify the arguments and formula derivations in section 4 , in order to make the text smoother and easier to follow . 2 ) I would also recommend to properly introduce the notation and definitions before presenting the model . 3 ) Graph Neuralization . The design and model choices seem to be arbitrary . Could the author ( s ) discuss further on it ? 4 ) Since the paper seems to be heavily focused on the application and the strong experimental results , I would suggest to explore additional options for the update operator of the graph neural network ( additionally to structure2vec ) . This would validate the actual benefit of the learning component . 5 ) Using only one dataset is restrictive in order to assess the generalisability of the method . I would consider to validate the model on additional real and/or simulated datasets % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % Thank you for your rebuttal and for answering my concerns .

The paper proposes to optimize the mutual information between testing predictions and the training data ( given input and meta model ) , and upper bound it by imposing a information bottleneck between output and input+model . Unlike related work , this paper specifically is able to generalize to meta-test even when the meta-train dataset is not made confusing enough ( i.e .even when model can learn well from test data in meta-train alone ) , making it applicable to use cases where it is hard to make the dataset confusing . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Decision I vote for accepting this paper , since as far as I know this paper gives a novel insight to the overfitting problem in meta learning , and has formulated the problem formally with theoretical insight , and given a working solution with strong experiment results and clean comparative studies . Despite somewhat narrow experiments and sometimes confusing writing , the paper should provide new insight to meta-learning . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Pros : ! DISCLAIMER : I am not an expert in this field , so take my novelty judgements with a grain of salt . + Novel view into meta-learning 's overfitting problem ( 1 ) Large models can simply memorize which input data corresponds to which task , and memorize the meta-training tasks , without being able to generalize into meta-test tasks . ( 2 ) Formulates this into a low mutual information between meta-train training data and predictions . + Easy to implement and quite widely applicable as a regularization loss addon to multiple existing meta-learning methods + Impact-wise , the paper takes meta-learning further from memorization , making methods more capable of operating on less-carefully designed , more natural datasets ( rather than permutation of datasets ) + Experiments are clean with ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity tests , and method performs well across real and toy datasets + Motivation part is easy to read # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Cons : - I 'm still skeptical of the novelty of the paper , since the conclusions are , in hindsight , very straightforward . - Sometimes sentences are very confusing to readers . ( 1 ) The term `` mutually-exclusive `` is confusing because the view-point example the paper gives seems to be mutually exclusive ( each task has its own kind of data , hence `` exclusive `` ) . It is unclear whether the task data is exclusive , or the task function is exclusive , and not straightforward to see its relationship with memorization . Consider renaming it to e.g . `` mutually-confusing `` or `` mutually-contradictory mapping `` . ( 2 ) Can you please rename `` information-theoretic meta-regularizer `` to `` meta-regularizer using information theory `` ? It is hard to read for non-native speakers . ( 3 ) Paragraph under definition 1 is confusing and has redundancies . ( 4 ) Section 4.1 , not very clear how the logic goes from the decomposition to adding the upper bound to the loss , and how the other term comes in . - For the motivation , it is better to give examples of use cases when it is impossible to make meta-train `` mutually-exclusive `` . I 'm sure even in the patient example you can shuffle classes or input dimensions . - An experiment comparing to others in mutually-exclusive datasets would be nice to have , in order to judge how much this compensates a badly-designed meta-learning dataset . # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Improvements : - Clarify each point in the `` Cons `` section . - Please also clarify if all methods in all experiments are hyperparameter-tuned separately , i.e .that the experiments are not favoring the MR-* model in any way . ( the paper only clarifies it in one of the experiments ) - For future work , does recent developments in mutual information modeling ( e.g .MINE https : //arxiv.org/abs/1801.04062 ) help this method in any way ? e.g .try increasing mutual information between some representation of the meta-train training data and some feature vectors before the prediction ? - First parenthesis in Section 4.1 has a misplaced space # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Post rebuttal # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # It seems that reviewers agree that the contributions are novel ( regardless of whether each reviewer thinks it is trivial ) . So that addresses my main concern . I think the contributions are novel enough since it gives theoretical guidance as well . Other concerns are mostly addressed by the rebuttal . I will keep my rating . Although I do urge the authors to reconsider the name choice `` mutual-exclusive tasks `` since it is not very informative and quite confusing to readers .\",\n          \"The authors of the article consider phase retrieval problems where the measurements have a specific form : they are the convolution of the n-dimensional input signal x with a random filter of length m . The authors show that , provided that m is larger than O ( n ) , up to log factors , and up to a term that is related with the sparsity of x in the Fourier domain , a simple non-convex algorithm can solve such problems with high probability . The proof is quite technical . Indeed , the measurement vectors are highly correlated with one another . To overcome this difficulty , the authors use `` decoupling techniques `` , together with results from [ Rauhut , 2010 ] and [ Krahmer , Mendelson , Rauhut , 2014 ] . I liked this article . I had not realized it was so complex to prove the convergence of a simple non-convex phase retrieval method in a very structured case , and , in my opinion , it is good that it has been done . The result by itself is interesting , and the proof techniques developed by the authors seem general enough to me so that they can be reused in other settings . As previously said , the proof is quite technical , and long . There are 38 pages in the appendix . I tried to read as much of it as possible , but , given the time constraints of the review process , I certainly did not have the time to deeply understand everything . However , what I read seems both clear and solid . The organization is also good . However , maybe the authors could discuss in more detail the case of coded diffraction patterns ( [ CLS15b ] ) . Indeed , the case of phase retrieval with coded diffraction patterns is , at least at first sight , very similar to the case considered in the article : seen in the Fourier domain , coded diffraction patterns consist in convolving the input signal with ( m/n ) random filters of length n , while , in convolutional phase retrieval , the input signal is convolved with a single random filter of length m. I would appreciate the authors to compare their result and their proof techniques with the ones obtained for coded diffraction patterns . Minor remarks and typos : - Before Equation ( 4 ) : add `` that `` ? - l.95 ( and also in the `` basic notations `` paragraph of the appendix ) : `` , because `` should be `` . Because `` . - Paragraph 3.1 : I did not know the name `` alternating direction method `` .

( More details to follow . ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Details : In this work , the author ( s ) consider , under a specific angle , the following quite fundamental question : `` what is the expressive power of a given class C of functions ( concepts ) ? `` A natural ( though maybe arguable , and not suitable for *all* purposes ) is to consider the logarithm of its size , log_2 |C| ( or , if C is infinite , the log of its measure , for a well-chosen notion thereof ; or the size of a minimum cover ) . Indeed , this is an approach well-studied in information theory and statistics , for instance ( see the related notions of VC dimension , covering number , bracketing entropy , etc . ) .With this in mind , the paper seeks to obtain tights bounds for classes C of Boolean functions ( f : { 0,1 } ^n \\\\to { 0,1 } ) such as ( i ) linear threshold functions ( LTF , halfspaces ) ( ii ) polynomial threshold functions ( PTF ) , ( iii ) restrictions thereof ( small weights , positive weights ) , and ( iv ) networks obtained by combining them . Now , this is indeed interesting . My main point is that these questions are quite hard , and as far as I can tell the results for ( iii ) , and ( iv ) are quite weak or straightforward . The main contribution of the paper is Theorem 3.1 , which provides and actual asymptotically tight bound for ( ii ) , the class of degree-d PTFs ( concluding a decades-long line of work , the previous bounds still being off by a factor d ) . More specifically : - Theorem 1 is a preliminary , and should be either a fact or a lemma - Theorem 3.1 is the main technical result , non-trivial , and ( in my opinion ) should be highlighted in the introduction as the key result - Theorem 4.1 is quite straightforward and easy ; and only deals with ( binary-weights ) LTFs , not PTFs - Theorem 4.2 is not tight ; and only deals with ( positive-weights ) LTFs , not PTFs - I am not able to really quantify the relevance of Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 . In summary , again : I feel the presentation distracts from the main result ( Theorem 3.1 ) , promising instead results about more general classes ( degree-d PTFs , networks of PTFs and LTFs , more general types of functions ... ) which end up being unaddressed or for which the results are much less impressive ( as in , they are not tight , or are simple corollaries ) . This is a bit disappointing , since Theorem 3.1 is very good by itself . ( Ironically , this is exactly what the supplemental material is : a math paper focusing entirely on , and dedicated to , Theorem 3.1 ) -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - More detailed comments ( technical , and typos ) below . - I am really not convinced Figure 1 is useful in any way to understand the paper . - l.41 Misleading . Phrased as it is , it sounds like this problem is still open , while ( as you mention later ) it has been settled since '89 . - l.60 and everywhere : `` i.e. `` - > `` i.e. , `` - eq ( 10 ) ( l.89 ) : `` leq `` - > `` \\\\leq `` - Section 3.1 ( e.g. , l.99 ) : you should also discuss Chow 's theorem , which gives such an interpretation and upper bound , as it states that any LTF is uniquely determined by its n+1 first Fourier coefficients . Now , since for a Boolean function each Fourier coefficient as granularity 1/2^ { n-1 } ... ( see e.g .discussion after Theorem 2.2 in https : //arxiv.org/abs/1511.07860 ) - l.104 : similar : you should discuss the degree-d PTF extension of Chow 's theorem , due to Bruck [ 1990 ] : see e.g .discussion at the end of https : //arxiv.org/abs/1206.0985 - Section 4.1 : for the sake of the literature review , mention that binary-weight LTFs are commonly referred to as `` signed majorities `` . Also , this section is quite misleading . You start by discussion binary-weight PTFs ( degree d , for general d ) , but prove essentially nothing ( except a possibly very loose easy upper bound ) for d > 1 ; only considering d=1 ( Theorem 4.1 ) . Moreover , a really relevant and important case ( as you mention ! ) is the case of bounded weights , say when the weights are constrained to be poly ( n ) ( see e.g .https : //arxiv.org/abs/1508.03061 ( STOC'17 ) and references within ) . Can you say anything for that case ? - l.147 : trailing period . - Theorem 4.2 : where was T [ N,1 ] introduced ? I could n't find that notation -- it looks like you are using it in lieu of C_1 [ N,1 ] ? Moreover , I do n't buy the `` As a result `` statement ( and the `` reduced by a linear factor `` which follows ) . You have N^2 ( 1+o ( 1 ) ) , so that the second order term you neglect is o ( N^2 ) . Since N is also o ( N^2 ) , you * can not * write and discuss this -N term ! It could be completely cancelled or drowned by the o ( N^2 ) ( which , as far as the statement of the theorem promises , cound be anything , say N^ { 1.999999 } ) - ll.178-179 : why is it a reasonable thing to do ? Detail .- Eq . ( 17 ) `` \\\\approx = `` - > `` \\\\approx `` Also , more generally ( Eq .16 , Eq .19 , Theorem 5 ... ) , you never have defined what \\\\approx means for you . Is it informal ? Is it notation for the Landau asymptotic \\\\sim ? You need to explain , as otherwise one can not make sense of it . For instance , in ( 17 ) using the Landau asymptotic equivalence ( which only `` guarantees `` anything meaningful for the first dominating term ) would be strange , as you give 3 terms . Do you mean instead `` = N^2 +N + o ( N ) `` ? `` = N^2 +N + O ( 1 ) `` ? `` = N^2 +N - 1 +o ( 1 ) `` ( which given the fact that sizes are integers , would lead to an actual exact equality ... ) ? In short : you are abusing asymptotic notation here , giving too many terms ( leading to a mistaken feeling of precision ) l.210 : typo ( `` threshold `` ) l.236 : typo ( `` layered `` ) l.272 : typo ( ref [ 17 ] ) : `` O'Donnell `` Again , the section title and introduction promise results about degree-d PTFs , but the only actual result is for d=1 .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 38,\n        \"min\": 1276,\n        \"max\": 1370,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1365,\n          1276,\n          1354\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
